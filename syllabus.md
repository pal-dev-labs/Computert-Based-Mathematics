# Computer-Based Mathematics

# Course Outline

## Phase 1: Foundations and Tools (Lessons 1-2)
- Lesson 1: "Hello World" Mathematics and Google Colab
o Introduction to the Google Colab environment (code cells vs. text).
o Python Base: Variables, data types, lists, and for/while loops.
o Lab: Writing scripts to calculate numerical sequences (e.g., Fibonacci) and basic mathematical algorithms (e.g., prime number verification).
- Lesson 2: The Science Lab (NumPy and Matplotlib)
o NumPy Library: From physical vectors to n-dimensional arrays.
o Matplotlib Library: Drawing points, lines, and curves on the Cartesian plane.
o Lab: Creating a plotter of elementary functions with Cartesian axes and a custom grid.
## Phase 2: Mathematical Modeling (Lessons 3-5)
- Lesson 3: Dynamic Analytical Geometry
o Curve Parameterization (Circle, Ellipse).
o Geometric transformations (rotations and translations) applied to plane figures.
o Lab: Simulation of planetary orbits or ballistic trajectories by modifying the equation parameters in real time.
- Lesson 4: Computational Mathematical Analysis
o Numerical function study: finding zeros (bisection method) and maxima/minima.
o Concept of limit and derivative via incremental ratio on discrete data.
o Lab: Visualization of the tangent line running along a complex function curve.
- Lesson 5: Probability and Statistics
o Random number generation and Monte Carlo simulations.
o Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) on small datasets.
o Lab: Simulate rolling 10,000 dice to verify the Law of Large Numbers and visualize the normal (Gaussian) distribution.
## Phase 3: Artificial Intelligence (Lesson 6)
- Lesson 6: Gemini API Integration in Python
o Setup: Create an API key and install the google-generativeai library in Colab.
o Programmatic Query: How to send a prompt to Gemini from code and receive a structured response.
o Lab: "The AI ​​Tutor." Create a script where the student enters a math problem or dataset, sends it to Gemini via the API, and the model returns a theoretical explanation or a suggestion on how to improve the Python code written so far.
## Phase 4: "Math-in-Code" Hackathon (Lessons 7-10)
- Lesson 7: Ideation and Setup (Hackathon Day 1)
o Divide into groups and choose a "Challenge" (Physics, Economics, Epidemiology, Biology, etc.).
o Use Gemini (via chat or API) to brainstorm the solution algorithm.
o Draft the project flowchart.
- Lesson 8: Core Development (Hackathon Day 2)
o Write the Python code for the mathematical model.
o Implement the calculations with NumPy.
o Instructor-assisted debugging.
- Lesson 9: Visualization and Refinement (Hackathon Day 3)
o Create the final graphs (Matplotlib) to make the data understandable.
o Final implementation: Insert a call to the Gemini API into the project to generate an automatic comment on the model's results (e.g., "Analyze this graph and tell me if the trend is positive").
- Lesson 10: Demo Day and Presentations (Hackathon Day 4)
o Finalize the Colab Notebooks.
o Present the projects to the class (15 minutes per group).
o Live demonstration of the mathematical model and AI integration.
