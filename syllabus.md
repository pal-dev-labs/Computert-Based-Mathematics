# Computer-Based Mathematics

# Course Outline

## Phase 1: Foundations and Tools (Lessons 1-2)
Lesson 1: "Hello World" Mathematics and Google Colab
-  Introduction to the Google Colab environment (code cells vs. text).
-  Python Base: Variables, data types, lists, and for/while loops.
-  Lab: Writing scripts to calculate numerical sequences (e.g., Fibonacci) and basic mathematical algorithms (e.g., prime number verification).

Lesson 2: The Science Lab (NumPy and Matplotlib)
- NumPy Library: From physical vectors to n-dimensional arrays.
- Matplotlib Library: Drawing points, lines, and curves on the Cartesian plane.
- Lab: Creating a plotter of elementary functions with Cartesian axes and a custom grid.
## Phase 2: Mathematical Modeling (Lessons 3-5)

Lesson 3: Dynamic Analytical Geometry
- Curve Parameterization (Circle, Ellipse).
- Geometric transformations (rotations and translations) applied to plane figures.
- Lab: Simulation of planetary orbits or ballistic trajectories by modifying the equation parameters in real time.

Lesson 4: Computational Mathematical Analysis
- Numerical function study: finding zeros (bisection method) and maxima/minima.
- Concept of limit and derivative via incremental ratio on discrete data.
- Lab: Visualization of the tangent line running along a complex function curve.

Lesson 5: Probability and Statistics
- Random number generation and Monte Carlo simulations.
- Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) on small datasets.
- Lab: Simulate rolling 10,000 dice to verify the Law of Large Numbers and visualize the normal (Gaussian) distribution.

## Phase 3: Artificial Intelligence (Lesson 6)
Lesson 6: Gemini API Integration in Python
- Setup: Create an API key and install the google-generativeai library in Colab.
- Programmatic Query: How to send a prompt to Gemini from code and receive a structured response.
- Lab: "The AI ​​Tutor." Create a script where the student enters a math problem or dataset, sends it to Gemini via the API, and the model returns a theoretical explanation or a suggestion on how to improve the Python code written so far.

## Phase 4: "Math-in-Code" Hackathon (Lessons 7-10)
Lesson 7: Ideation and Setup (Hackathon Day 1)
- Divide into groups and choose a "Challenge" (Physics, Economics, Epidemiology, Biology, etc.).
- Use Gemini (via chat or API) to brainstorm the solution algorithm.
- Draft the project flowchart. Lesson 8: Core Development (Hackathon Day 2)
- Write the Python code for the mathematical model.
- Implement the calculations with NumPy.
- Instructor-assisted debugging.

Lesson 9: Visualization and Refinement (Hackathon Day 3)
- Create the final graphs (Matplotlib) to make the data understandable.
- Final implementation: Insert a call to the Gemini API into the project to generate an automatic comment on the model's results (e.g., "Analyze this graph and tell me if the trend is positive").

Lesson 10: Demo Day and Presentations (Hackathon Day 4)
- Finalize the Colab Notebooks.
- Present the projects to the class (15 minutes per group).
- Live demonstration of the mathematical model and AI integration.
