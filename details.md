# Computer-Based Mathematics

## FSL Path Datasheet: "Computer-Based Mathematics"
1. Introduction and Rationale
The "Matematica al Calcolatore" (Computer-Based Mathematics) project stems from the need to provide students with cognitive tools suited to the complexity of contemporary society through the use of calculation and modeling software. The use of the computer is not intended as a mere technical skill, but as a transversal competence that enables students to process data, analyze mathematical models, and systematically design solutions to real-world problems.

2. Educational and Interdisciplinary Value
The path aims to overcome the fragmentation of knowledge by offering points of contact with various disciplines:

Scientific-Mathematical Field: Strengthening formal logic, geometric visualization, and the hypothetical-deductive method through numerical and symbolic calculation.

Humanistic Field: Developing data interpretation skills and terminological precision in model description.

Relational Field: Promoting critical discussion and collaboration through group work and the comparison of computer-generated results.

3. Path Structure and FSL Value
The project is configured as an internal FSL path for the following reasons:

Active Orientation: It allows students to test their aptitudes for STEM careers, data analysis, and high-tech professional profiles.

Certification of Competencies: Upon completion, the school will issue a certificate verifying the hours completed and the skills acquired (Modeling, Data Analysis, Verification of Results), ensuring direct inclusion in the Student's Curriculum.

Inclusivity: Since it is provided internally, it guarantees all students equal opportunities to access advanced software tools, regardless of family economic resources.

4. Methodology and Evaluation
The path favors a Learning by Doing methodology. Students will not be passive spectators but protagonists in building digital mathematical models. The final evaluation will not be limited to correct calculation but will account for the logical process followed and the ability to validate results and correct models (procedural debugging), a fundamental skill for personal and professional growth.

# SKILLS THAT ARE INTENDED TO BUILD/DEVELOP
The skills that students will develop during the "Matematica con il calcolatore" path are broad and aim to provide a solid foundation in the field of Coding and Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to the practical approach and direct interaction with advanced tools such as Python and Gemini, students will acquire technical, analytical and problem solving skills. Here is a description of the main skills developed:
1. Programming and technical skills in Python:
o Students will learn the basics of programming in Python, with a focus on the use of scientific libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib. These skills will allow them to collect, organize, analyze and visualize data in an interactive and clear way, fundamental skills for those working in the Data Science field.
2. Use of Artificial Intelligence models:
o Students will learn how to exploit advanced linguistic models such as ChatGPT and Gemini to automate complex tasks and improve data analysis processes. They will be able to use these tools to explore datasets, generate custom Python code for analysis, and create interactive reports, making their work more efficient and structured.
3. Math model, Data analysis and problem solving:
o Through projects on real data, students will develop the ability to create mathematical models, analyze and clean datasets, extract significant insights, and draw useful conclusions. They will learn to solve real-world problems in sectors such as the environment, economics, or marketing, providing data-driven solutions to support fact-based decisions.
4. Teamwork and project management:
o During the second phase of the path, students will work in groups on data analysis projects. They will learn to collaborate in teams, manage deadlines and divide tasks to complete a common project. This experience will prepare them to work in professional and academic contexts where cooperation is essential.
5. Critical thinking and decision-making skills:
o The entire path will stimulate students to develop strong critical thinking. Thanks to the use of data science and machine learning techniques, they will be able to tackle complex problems, analyze different solutions and choose the most effective one, based on a solid understanding of the data.
6. Communication skills and data presentation:
o At the end of the path, students will be able to create clear and interactive reports, presenting their analyses in a way that is understandable to both technical and non-technical audiences. This skill will be particularly useful to translate the results of their research into concrete actions and to communicate effectively with colleagues or superiors

# Course Structure:
The "Computer-Based Mathematics" course is structured to provide students with a solid and applicative foundation in the field of Mathematic models, Data Science, with a practical approach to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and programming.
30 hours of FSL will be recognized only in the case of delivery of the final paper.
The course is aimed at motivated students with a strong interest in computer science and programming languages ​​and is organized as follows:

• The first training phase is divided into 6 in-person or online meetings, lasting 3 hours each, in which students will learn to use data analysis tools, such as Python, and to exploit the potential of advanced linguistic models such as ChatGPT and Gemini, to solve real problems through machine learning.
• A second phase in which students, divided into groups, will be engaged in the creation of a project that will involve the preparation of an analysis on real data (environmental, economic, marketing, etc.) in order to extract useful information to achieve some objectives.

# Learning Methods:
The course combines lectures, hands-on programming exercises, collaborative projects, and real-world applications to ensure a well-rounded learning experience. Students will engage in problem-solving and critical thinking exercises that promote a deeper understanding of the material.
The course covers many topics related to different scientific disciplines such as Mathematics, Physics, Data Science, Computer Science and therefore there is no single textbook that contains all the topics.
