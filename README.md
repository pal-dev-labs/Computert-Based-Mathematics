# Computer-Based Mathematics

Grade Level: High School

Duration: 6 months

[IIS Ettore Majorana - via ROMA 298 - Guidonia](https://www.liceoguidonia.edu.it/)

Teacher: Prof. Giandomenico Palumbo

**The content of this course evolves in line with technological evolution**

# Course start/end date
The course starts on 19 feb 2026 and ends at the end of June. The course lasts 3 hours per week at Computer Science Laboratory, IIS headquarters via Roma 298. For details refer to [Course Details](./details.md)

# Overview
Throughout the course, students will gradually learn the Python programming language, how to use Gemini AI to build specific code, and how to code and solve a mathematical/physical model with Python.
The activity will be entirely laboratory-based in a Google Colab environment (alternatively, students can use their own laptop), with specific integration of the Gemini APIs. A final Hackathon is planned, in which groups of students will compete in a test involving the analysis of a real mathematical/physical model. [Course Details](./details.md)

# Instructions
You can follow the course with a laptop of the computer lab.
The coding environment that will be adopted is **Google Colab** which can be accessed with a browser (Chrome for example) from any PC, directly from the address https://colab.research.google.com/

In order to access the Google Colab environment you need a **Google account** (if you are not already provided with you can get one from the site https://www.google.com/intl/it/account/about/). Once you have created the Google account, try to log in to Google Colab to verify the access.

To import materials into Colab you also need a **GitHub account**. If you do not have one, you can create it from the website https://github.com/join

In order to check if everything is ok I suggest to follow the video here https://youtu.be/j7d2H6phnnQ

**REMEMBER** to bring with you to the computer lab **UID and PWD to access both Google and GitHub accounts**.

To follow the course, you can also use a personal laptop.
In this case you can choose to use either the Google Colab enviroment or the suite **Anaconda Navigator**, installed on your laptop
You can download **Anaconda Navigator** suite from the website https://www.anaconda.com/download. For the installation you can follow the video instructions published on the classroom website of the course (see below) or viewable on my YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mo3EP4Hy-k&t=115s
(Unfortunately with personal laptop you could experience problems with internet connection due to poor wi-fi internet connection)

# Google Classroom work environment
The course materials and any communications are published here on github and in a dedicated Google Classroom environment, available from the following link https://classroom.google.com/u/1/c/NzE5NDg1NDk3Mjg3

# Teaching material and useful links
The course covers many topics related to different scientific disciplines such as Mathematics, Physics, Data Science, Computer Science and therefore there is no single textbook that contains all the topics.
Below is a list of the material that can be consulted for specific in-depth analysis.

1. Anaconda Navigator
